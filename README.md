#### Workflow
Work cycle should go as follows:
- make changes in development theme:

    `$ npm run dev`
  - if a feature or ongoing iteration needed, stash and create branch. Commit changes in branch to swap between theme and new branch:

  Commit individual files to repo while in development.
  Once complete, push individual files to production:

    `$ theme deploy <filename> <filename> --env=production`

  Check production in browser for changes, making sure development preview is turned off.
